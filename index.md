### Working Papers

**[Trademark Protection, Profits and Product Quality](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2798473)** *Under Review*

We study the effects of trademark protection on firm profits and strategy. Using diff-in-diff and switching estimates around the passage and nullification of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA), we find that from 1996 to 2002 the FTDA raised treated firmsâ€™ operating margin by 12% and channeled $691 billion in operating profits to incumbent firms. The FTDA was followed by a spike in trademark dilution lawsuits and increased concentration and reduced entry into affected industries. Treated firms responded by lowering product quality and innovation, and extending protected brands into all-new product markets.

**[Bias-Corrected Estimation of Price Impact in Securities Litigation](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3005878)** *Under Review*

Price impacts in legal event studies are systematically overestimated, a problem that carries over into damages calculations and results in securities litigation being settled or decided for excessive damages. We quantify and examine the bias using the empirical distribution of daily stock returns, and develop bias-corrected estimators of price impacts for single-event studies. **[Replication Code](https://github.com/davidsontheath/bias_corrected_estimators)**

**[Macroeconomic Factors in Oil Futures Markets](dheath_MFOF.pdf)** *Revise & Resubmit, Management Science*

I construct a macro-finance model for commodity futures that admits unspanned macroeconomic state variables. There is a negative feedback relationship between crude oil prices and real economic activity. The channel from real activity to oil prices is unspanned - that is, it is not identified in the contemporaneous futures curve - consistent with futures as a hedge asset against supply shocks. Unspanned macroeconomic risks have large effects on oil risk premiums and real options values which are missed by previous models.

**[Convergence Failure in CBOT Wheat Futures](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2275088)**

Massive convergence failures in CBOT agricultural contracts in 2007-2008 were caused by caps on the fees that storage providers could charge holders of delivery certificates.
