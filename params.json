My advisor is [Wayne Ferson](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~ferson/).\r\n\r\nI will be interviewing at the AFA 2015 Annual Meeting in Boston.\r\n\r\n[CV](dheath_CV.pdf)\r\n\r\n[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=354539786)\r\n\r\n###Working Papers\r\n\r\n[Unspanned Macroeconomic Risks in Oil Futures](dheath_JMP.pdf) _Job Market Paper; Under Review_\r\n\r\nI construct an affine macro-finance model for commodity futures that admits unspanned macroeconomic state variables. There is a negative feedback relationship between oil prices and aggregate growth. Aggregate economic activity drives an unspanned procylical risk premium in oil futures. The model estimates have implications for real options pricing and the properties of the convenience yield.  [Slides](dheath_JMP_slides.pdf)\r\n\r\n[Technology and Real Options: Evidence from Patent Text](dheath_patents_realoptions.pdf)\r\n\r\nI construct new measures of firm-level innovation using the text of all U.S. patents from 1926 to 2010. Technological differentiation predicts product market differentiation and is associated with higher ROA, capex, Q, and TFP. Technological differentiation is associated with lower returns but product market differentiation is not, consistent with a model of firms holding growth options on heterogeneous innovations.

Model estimates provide strong evidence that the slope of futures prices reflects changing risk premiums and not forecasts of future prices.\r\n\r\n[Convergence Failure in CBOT Wheat Futures](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2275088) _Permanent working paper_\r\n\r\nMassive convergence failures in CBOT agricultural contracts in 2007-2008 were caused by caps on the fees that storage providers could charge holders of delivery certificates.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-55263004-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
